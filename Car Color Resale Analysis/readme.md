# Impact of Car Color on Resale Value: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview

This research project investigates how car color affects resale value in the used car market. By analyzing over 400,000 Craigslist listings, we explore whether certain colors retain value better than others and how price stability varies by color. Using data cleaning techniques, statistical tests, and Bayesian analysis, we uncover key insights for car buyers and sellers.

## Research Questions

-   Do certain car colors correlate with higher resale prices?
-   Which colors have the most stable resale values over time?
-   How does color impact the depreciation rate of used cars?

## Dataset

-   **Source:** [Kaggle - Craigslist Cars & Trucks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/data)
-   **Size:** 426,000+ listings
-   **Features Used:** Car color, price, mileage, make, model, year, etc.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**:

    - Standardized color names (e.g., "gray" vs. "grey").
    - Removed extreme outliers in pricing.
    - Filtered listings with incomplete or inconsistent data.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:

    - Conducted a permutation test to determine if color significantly affects price.
    - Measured price stability by tracking resale value fluctuations over time.

3. **Bayesian Analysis**:
    - Evaluated probability distributions of different colors achieving higher resale values.
    - Assessed the stability of resale prices for different colors.

## Key Findings

-   **Neutral colors (white, black, silver)** tend to retain their value best.
-   **Bright colors (yellow, orange, green)** have lower resale values due to niche appeal.
-   **Red** cars perform better than expected, maintaining relatively strong resale value.
-   **White and black** vehicles show the most stable depreciation trends over time.

## Recommendations

-   **For maximum resale value**, opt for neutral colors like white, black, or silver.
-   **Avoid niche colors** unless you're okay with a smaller buyer pool and potential lower resale value.
-   **Red cars** offer a balance between a sporty appearance and decent resale performance.
